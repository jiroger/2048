<h1> Knock-Off 2048</h1>
<p>
Pretty much what the title says. If you want to download the runnable JAR file (I wrote the program using Java/Processing), <a href="https://jiroger.github.io/assets/code/Run2048"> click here </a>. As much as I had hoped to integrate this applet into a webpage, I couldn't since most modern browsers are dropping support for the applet tag, which was the primary method for deploying Java applets on the web.
