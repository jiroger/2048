Pretty much what the title says. If you want to download the runnable JAR file, <a href="https://jiroger.github.io/assets/code/Run2048"> click here </a>. I couldn't integrate this applet into a webpage because most modern browsers are dropping support for the applet tag, which was designed specifically for Java applets.
