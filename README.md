<h1> Knock-Off 2048</h1>
<p>
I'll be honest: I spent way too much damn time playing this game when it first came out. And even as the craze subsided, I still couldn't get over it. So I decided to make an offline version, one you could download on your computer and play whenever you want (at productivity's expense). 
</p>

I wrote this little applet using Java and Processing. <a href="https://jiroger.github.io/assets/code/Run2048"> Click here </a> to download the runnable `Run2048.jar` file and say hello to procrastination! Or, if you want to peek at the code, clone this repo and dig in.
